This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common off-by-one error in array iteration. The `Bug.java` file shows the buggy code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition, leading to an attempt to access an index outside the bounds of the array. This example highlights the importance of careful loop condition design when working with arrays.
